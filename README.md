# Insightforge AI Blog Generator

Insightforge AI Blog Generator is an AI-powered content creation tool that leverages the Gemini model and CrewAI agents to generate high-quality blog posts and social media kits. Using a streamlined workflow, it produces multiple drafts and optimizes content for SEO and publication readiness. The project features a Streamlit web interface for easy topic input and preview of the final blog post and social media content.

## Features

- AI-driven research on emerging tech trends using a specialized Researcher agent.
- Automated blog post drafting by a Writer agent.
- SEO optimization with keyword analysis and metadata enhancement by an SEO Optimizer agent.
- Editorial review and polishing by an Editor agent.
- Social media content generation tailored for Twitter, LinkedIn, and Instagram â€” including platform-specific posts, hashtags, optimal posting times, and engagement tips.
- Streamlit-based user interface for topic input and preview of generated content.
- Generation of four key output files:
  - `draft-blog-post.md`
  - `seo-optimized-post.md`
  - `final-blog-post.md`
  - `social-media-kit.md`

## How It Works

The system uses the CrewAI framework to orchestrate multiple AI agents, each with a specific role:

1. **Researcher Agent**: Investigates and delivers deep insights on the given topic, gathering credible information and trend analysis.
2. **Writer Agent**: Converts research into a clear, engaging blog post draft.
3. **SEO Optimizer Agent**: Enhances the blog post for search engine visibility with keyword optimization and metadata improvements.
4. **Editor Agent**: Polishes the blog post for grammar, tone, flow, and publication readiness.
5. **Social Media Promoter Agent**: Creates platform-specific social media posts to promote the blog content.

Each agent uses specialized tools powered by the Gemini model, including web search, website scraping, SEO analysis, grammar checking, and social media post generation.

The agents work sequentially through defined tasks, producing intermediate and final markdown files.
